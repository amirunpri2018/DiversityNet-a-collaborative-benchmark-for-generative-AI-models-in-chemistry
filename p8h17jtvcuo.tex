\[ H(A) = -\int_\mathbb{{S}^n}  \hat{f}_h(x)\log  \hat{f}_h(x) \,dx  \]



where $dx$ is the \href{ }{spherical measure} on $\mathbb{{S}^n}$ (the invariant measure has density $m(x)=1$). We need an embedding into the unit sphere because there is no probability measure on the chemical space.

Note that this entropy depends on the choice of the bandwidth $h$ and of the embedding.

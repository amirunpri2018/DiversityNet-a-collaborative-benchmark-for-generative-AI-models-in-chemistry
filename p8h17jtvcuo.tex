\[ H(A) = -\int_\mathbb{{S}^n}  \hat{f}_h(x)\log  \hat{f}_h(x) \,dx  \]



where $dx$ is the Spherical measure on $\mathbb{{S}^n}$ (the invariant measure has density $m(x)=1$. Wee need an embedding into the because there is no probability measure on the chemical space).Â 
This entropy depends on the bandwidth h and on the embedding.

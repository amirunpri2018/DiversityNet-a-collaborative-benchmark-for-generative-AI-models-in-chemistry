\[ H(A) = -\int_\mathbb{{S}^n}  \hat{f}_h(x)\log  \hat{f}_h(x) \,dx  \]



he invariant measure where dx is the Spherical measure on Sn (the invariant measure has density $m(x)=1$ (we need an embedding because there is no probability measure on the chemical space).Â 
This entropy depends on the bandwidth h and on the embedding.

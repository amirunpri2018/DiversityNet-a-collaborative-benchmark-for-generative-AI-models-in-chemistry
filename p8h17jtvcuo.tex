\[ H(A) = -\int_\mathbb{S}^n f(x)\log f(x)\,dx  \]



The invariant measure where dx is the Spherical measure on Sn (the invariant measure has density $m(x)=1$ (we need an embedding because there is no probability measure on the chemical space).Â 
This entropy depends on the bandwidth h and on the embedding.

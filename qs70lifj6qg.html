<div></div><div>Then consider an embedding of the chemical space into the unit sphere&nbsp;<b>S</b><sup>n</sup>, (typically, n ~ 300). For example, Smiles2Vec (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02034" target="_blank">PNNL</a>). Such embedding is analogous to Word2Vec in Natural Language Processing. Then we identify a molecule inThe invariant measure where dx is the Spherical measure on Sn (we need an embedding because there is no probability measure on the chemical space)</div>

<h1 data-label="351577" class="ltx_title_section">Diversity metrics</h1><div>Designing evaluation metrics is an important part of the challenge. These metrics assess the quality and diversity of generated samples. Here, contributions from medicinal chemists and statisticians are especially welcome.</div><div>Measures of diversity are based on  distance metrics in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_space" target="_blank">chemical space</a>. This distance tells when two molecules are chemically close to each other. The most popular distance is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index#Tanimoto_similarity_and_distance" target="_blank">Tanimoto distance</a> on <a href="https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/Extended+Connectivity+Fingerprint+ECFP" target="_blank"> Morgan fingerprints</a>. It’s not necessary to get into details of the definition, the point is that those fingerprints are hand-crafted features, and it’s probably better to replace them with deep learning features, as suggested in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00564" target="_blank">MoleculeNet benchmark</a>.&nbsp;</div><div>Let’s denote:</div><ul><li>&nbsp;<i>T<sub>d</sub> </i>the distance in the chemical space.</li><li><i>A</i> the set of generated molecules with desired properties, of size |<i>A</i>|.</li><li><i>B</i> the training set.</li></ul><div></div>

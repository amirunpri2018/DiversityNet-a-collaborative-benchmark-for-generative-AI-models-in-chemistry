<div>On the other hand, DiversityNet is a <b>challenge</b> “<b>in the wild”</b>, which means that the challenge is also about defining those proper tasks, metrics and datasets. As a result, instead of competing against each other, participants are invited to <b>collaborate like one big team</b>, for both the design and execution of the benchmark. Their joint output is a research paper, together with open-source code and data. The challenge is open to all, and target participants include data scientists and medicinal chemists, whose skills are complementary.</div><div>Competitive challenges are a winner-take-all game, while in a <b>collaborative challenge</b>, sponsors distribute prize shares proportionally to individual contributions. For more details, see the <a href="https://medium.com/@mostafab/f1b9cc669cba#134f" target="_blank"><b>call for sponsors</b></a><b> </b>below.</div><div>Writing a paper collaboratively has been done recently for a review in <a href="https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review" target="_blank">deep learning for medicine</a>, using GitHub. But for writing the DiversityNet paper, GitHub is an inappropriate tool, because GitHub does not natively <a href="https://github.com/github/markup/issues/897#issuecomment-288580903" target="_blank">support math formulas</a>.</div><div>There are many alternatives (<a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#math" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/" target="_blank">Overleaf</a>…), and I suggest trying <a href="https://www.authorea.com" target="_blank">Authorea</a>, which allows <a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/3/articles/108532-how-is-authorea-different-from-sharelatex-and-overleaf" target="_blank">real-time collaboration</a> between LaTeX users (data scientists, for example) and non-LaTeX users (medicinal chemists, for example).

These metrics assess the quality and diversity of generated samples. Here, contributions from medicinal chemists and statisticians are especially welcome.</div><div>Measures of diversity are based on  distance metrics in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_space" target="_blank">chemical space</a>. This distance tells when two molecules are chemically close to each other. The most popular distance is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index#Tanimoto_similarity_and_distance" target="_blank">Tanimoto distance</a> on <a href="https://docs.chemaxon.com/display/docs/Extended+Connectivity+Fingerprint+ECFP" target="_blank"> Morgan fingerprints</a>. It’s not necessary to get into details of the definition, the point is that those fingerprints are hand-crafted features, and it’s probably better to replace them with deep learning features, as suggested in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00564" target="_blank">MoleculeNet benchmark</a>.&nbsp;</div><div>In any case, having good chemical distances is very important, because all diversity measures depend on them.&nbsp;</div><div>Let’s denote:</div><ul><li>&nbsp;<i>Td </i>the distance in the chemical space.</li><li><i>A</i> the set of generated molecules with desired properties.</li><li><i>B</i> the training set.</li></ul><div>Let’s define:&nbsp;</div><ul><li><b>Nearest neighbor diversity</b>: it’s the average distance between a generated molecule in <i>A</i> and its nearest neighbor in the training set <i>B</i>.

<h4>Get inspiration from computer&nbsp;vision&nbsp;</h4><div>To find out better metrics in chemistry, it helps having a look at related metrics in computer vision (GAN and stuff). However, it is important to keep in mind that goals are different: in chemistry, the goal is to generate molecules with new and nice properties, while in computer vision, the goal is to <a href="https://blog.openai.com/generative-models/" target="_blank">reconstruct training data</a>.</div><ul><li><b>Inception Score</b> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>): This metric uses the Inception predictive model, which is a standard image classifier (a winner of the ImageNet challenge). A generative model has a high Inception score when the Inception model is very confident that generated images belong to a particular ImageNet category, and when all categories are equally represented. This suggests that the generative model has both high quality and diversity.</li></ul>
